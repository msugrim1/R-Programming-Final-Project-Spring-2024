The purpose behind Simple_LM_and_Plot is to simplify plotting coordinates using ggplot and lm in an efficient manner. 
There is a noted amount of tediousness when it comes to creating plots for GGPlot and doing regression analysis for LM. 
Simple_LM_and_Plot makes this process a little easy by simplifying these steps by having LM coded into a function 
and having GGPlot coded into a function to plot coordinates onto a map. For the sake of this package,
I went ahead and used these functions to plot out coordinates and calculate linear regression in 
examining school neighborhood poverty using current data.
